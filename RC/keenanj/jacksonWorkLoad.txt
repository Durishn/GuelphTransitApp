The majority of my time was spent working with the Google Maps API and location sensing and calculation. The includes; 
	- The placement of all map markers for home, favourites, and location views
	- Calculating distances between locations for location view
	- ClickListeners for the Bottom Bars and Map Markers
	- Polylines for the Routes

I additionally spent some time working with the Web Scraper with Aidan as well as some work with switching between the 3 views (home,favourites,location)
